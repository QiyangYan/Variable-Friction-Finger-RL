## Description


## Action Space
The action space is a `Box(-1, 1, (2,), float32)`. The first control action is the absolute angular positions of the actuated left finger joint. The second control action is the friction state of the gripper. The input of the control actions is set to a range between -1 and 1 by scaling the actual actuator angle ranges. The elements of the action array are the following:

| Num | Action                                              | Control Min | Control Max | Angle Min    | Angle Max   | Name (in corresponding XML file) | Joint | Unit        |
| --- | ----------------------------------------------------| ----------- | ----------- | ------------ | ----------  |--------------------------------- | ----- | ----------- |
| 0   | Angular position of the left finger                 | -1          | 1           | 0 (rad) | 2.0944 (rad)  | robot0:A_WRJ1                    | hinge | angle (rad) |
| 1   | Friction States                                     | -1          | 1           | 0 (rad) | 0.34 (rad) | joint:leftInsert & joint:rightInsert    | hinge | angle (rad) |


## Observation Space
The observation is a goal-aware observation space. It consists of a dictionary with information about the robotâ€™s joint and block states, as well as information about the goal. The dictionary consists of the following 3 keys:

* `observation`: its value is an `ndarray` of shape `(22,)`. It consists of kinematic information of the block object and finger joints. The elements of the array correspond to the following:
