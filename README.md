# Variable-Friction-Finger-Model-free-RL

## Introduction
Welcome to the repository for our project: **Model-Free Gripper Control for Multi-Shape Objects using Reinforcement Learning**. This project addresses the limitation of existing algorithms that provide control in a model-based manner. Our approach leverages reinforcement learning to achieve multi-shape control without relying on a pre-existing model. This approach enhances the gripper's extension potential, allowing for more versatile and adaptive control.

The project is built upon the Gymnasium API and employs the MuJoCo physics engine for simulation. We've drawn inspiration and references from the Gymnasium Robotics framework to develop our solution.
