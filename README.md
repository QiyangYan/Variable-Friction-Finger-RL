# Variable-Friction-Finger-Model-free-RL

## Introduction
Welcome to the repository for our project: **Model-Free Gripper Control for Multi-Shape Objects using Reinforcement Learning**. This project addresses the limitation of existing algorithms that provide control in a model-based manner. Our approach leverages reinforcement learning to achieve multi-shape control without relying on a pre-existing model. This approach enhances the gripper's extension potential, allowing for more versatile and adaptive control.

The project is built upon the Gymnasium API and employs the MuJoCo physics engine for simulation. We've drawn inspiration and references from the Gymnasium Robotics framework to develop our solution.

## Only Sliding Training Success Rate
But since I don't have enough computation to have enough workers, I only trained several epochs to test the improvement from training. As you can see from the graph, the diagram shows decent increase in success rate with a good trend. Train further if you are interested, and I will finalise trainings when I have successfully applied a virtual machine.

## Only Sliding Training Success Rate
Due to computational constraints, I trained only a few epochs to assess the improvement from training. The graph depicts a promising increase in success rate. Interested users are encouraged to extend the training. I will finalize the trainings once I have access to a virtual machine.
