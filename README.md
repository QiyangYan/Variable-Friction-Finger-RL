## Introduction
Welcome to the repository for our project: Model-Free Gripper Control for Multi-Shape Objects using Reinforcement Learning. This project addresses the limitations of existing algorithms that control in a model-based manner. Leveraging reinforcement learning, our approach achieves multi-shape control without relying on pre-existing models, enhancing the gripper's versatility and adaptability.

The project utilises the Gymnasium API and employs the MuJoCo physics engine for simulations. Our work draws inspiration from the Gymnasium Robotics framework.

## Only Sliding Training Success Rate
Due to computational constraints, I trained only a few epochs to assess the improvement from training. The graph depicts a promising increase in success rate. Interested users are encouraged to extend the training. I will finalize the trainings once I have access to a virtual machine.
